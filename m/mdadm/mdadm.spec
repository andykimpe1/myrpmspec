%description 
The mdadm program is used to create, manage, and monitor Linux MD (software
RAID) devices.  As such, it provides similar functionality to the raidtools
package.  However, mdadm is a single program, and it can perform
almost all functions without a configuration file, though a configuration
file can be used to help with some common tasks.

  having the same infinite loop as in bz569019 again even if we change file
  locations to somewhere where we can't create a mapfile

* Tue Mar 16 2010 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.1.2-1
- Grab latest upstream release instead of git repo snapshot (bz552344, bz572561)
- The lack of /dev/md is causing problems, so add code to mapfile.c to cause
  us to create /dev/md if it doesn't exist (bz569019)

* Sun Feb 21 2010 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.1.1-0.gcd9a8b5.5
- The uuid patch cause a different problem during assembly, so use a gross
  hack to work around the uuid issue that won't break assembly until fixed

- Don't run the raid-check script if the kernel doesn't support
  md devices (bz557053)
- Don't report any mismatch_cnt issues on raid1 devices as there are
  legitimate reasons why the count may not be 0 and we are getting enough
  false positives that it renders the check useless (bz554217, bz547128)

* Thu Feb 18 2010 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.1.1-0.gcd9a8b5.2

* Wed Nov 04 2009 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.0.3-1
- New upstream release 3.0.3 (bz523320, bz527281)
- Update a couple internal patches
- Drop a patch in that was in Neil's tree for 3.0.3 that we had pulled for
  immediate use to resolve a bug
- Drop the endian patch because it no longer applied cleanly and all attempts
  to reproduce the original problem as reported in bz510605 failed, even up
  to and including downloading the specific package that was reported as
  failing in that bug and trying to reproduce with it on both ppc and ppc64
  hardware and with both ppc and ppc64 versions on the 64bit hardware.
  Without a reproducer, it is impossible to determine if a rehashed patch
  to apply to this code would actually solve the problem, so remove the patch
  entirely since the original problem, as reported, was an easy to detect DOA
  issue where installing to a raid array was bound to fail on reboot and so
  we should be able to quickly and definitively tell if the problem resurfaces.

* Tue May 19 2009 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.0-0.devel3.7

* Fri Mar 20 2009 Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com> - 3.0-0.devel3.3
- Slightly tweak the udev rules to make sure we don't start arrays
  while running in rc.sysinit...leave array starting to it instead
- Modify mdadm to put its mapfile in /dev/md instead of /var/run/mdadm
  since at startup /var/run/mdadm is read-only by default and this
  breaks incremental assembly
- Change how mdadm decides to assemble incremental devices using their

- Remove the new mdadm rules file from upstream as we already have this in
